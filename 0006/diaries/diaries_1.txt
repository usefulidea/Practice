It’s not easy to live every moment wholly aware of death. It’s like trying to stare the sun in the face: you can standonly so much of it.

We project ourselves into the future through our children; we grow rich, famous, ever larger; we develop compulsive protective rituals; or we embrace an impregnable belief in an ultimate rescuer.
