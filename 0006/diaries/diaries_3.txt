In China, the students have to take part in many exams, they need to get the high mark so that they can enter a better school and have more chances to get to the college. Chinese education pays special attention to the score, it occupies an important position, and it seems that score decides the students’ future. In my opinion, a score doesn’t mean everything, the score just proves that the student is good at studying, but not including his ability in other things. I have a classmate, who is good at studying, every time when he takes an exam, he almost can get the full mark, but he is weak in-hand work. When the teacher asks us to make some artwork, he always fails and even doesn’t want to finish it. A high score doesn’t mean overall ability, we should pay more attention to our ability in life, it can make sure we are a better man.
